This application is a simple example of AutoML with KNIME Software for binary and multiclass classification. The key of this example is the AutoML Component verified and developed by the KNIME Team. This Component (in green) uses the extension KNIME Integrated Deployment in order to train several models and combine them with other nodes and output a deployment workflow. The other Components (in blue) offer interactive views to control the AutoML process from any web browser via the KNIME WebPortal on KNIME Server. &#xd;
&#xd;
The workflow also works locally on KNIME Analytics Platform. Make sure to use "Apply and Close" in bottom-right corner of each view.&#xd;
